                <p>I am 20! I am from Fergana, Uzbekistan. I have been working as a web-desinger for a long time- since I remember myself. I have a very strong passion in everything I do. Every client is really important for me.
                   I am very experienced. I have had membership with more than 100+ well-known companies around the world. You can have a very detailed look at my CV in the link provided below. By the way, the website is not done by me. 
                   I am not even aware of this website. it was created from scratch by 00010114 to fulfil the requirements of CW given by Web Technologies module at WIUT.
